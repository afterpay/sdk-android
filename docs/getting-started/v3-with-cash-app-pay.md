This method requires importing and implementing the Cash App PayKit SDK in addition to the Afterpay SDK.

Follow along with the [example implementation](https://github.com/afterpay/sdk-android/blob/master/sample/src/main/java/com/example/CashAppV3SampleActivity.kt).

# Initial Setup

## Import the Cash App Pay Kit Dependency

You can get the latest version of the SDK from Maven. This is the import definition using Gradle:

```gradle
implementation "app.cash.paykit:core:2.3.0"
```

For definitions of other build systems, see [Cash App Pay Kit on Maven Central][cash-on-maven]{:target="_blank"}.

{: .info }
> Version `v2.3.0` of the SDK is `12.3 kB`.

## Implement Deep Linking

The authorization flow will bring Cash App to the foreground on the Customerâ€™s device. After the Customer either authorizes or declines, the Cash App Pay SDK will attempt to return your app to the foreground.  This is accomplished by [declaring an intent filter][intent-filter]{:target="_blank"} on your app's Android Manifest. You will pass a corresponding redirect URI when launching Cash App Pay SDK, see steps below.

```xml
<!-- Intent filter to allow Cash App Pay SDK to redirect to your app.
	Consider creating a custom scheme to ensure only your app is launched. -->
<intent-filter>
  <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
    <data
       android:host="example.com"
      android:scheme="example" />

  <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
  <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
</intent-filter>
```

# Authorization steps

## Step 1: Set merchant configurations

{: .note }
> Confirm that the Afterpay SDK is configured per the [instructions][configure-afterpay] before attempting to access `Afterpay.environment.payKitClientId`.

```kotlin
Afterpay.setConfigurationV3(configurations)
```

## Step 2: Create `CashAppPay` instance and register a state listener

To create a new instance of `CashAppPay`, you must pass the `clientId`. This is a required field. This can be retrieved through the Afterpay object: `Afterpay.environment.payKitClientId`.

You should use `CashAppPayFactory` to create an instance of `CashAppPay`. When doing so, you must specify the environment you will use, Sandbox or Production. The function `createSandbox()` will create an instance in the Sandbox environment.

{: .info }
> You should use the Sandbox environment during the development phase and the Production environment for your production releases.


{: .info }
**Optional:** We recommend using the [Cash App Sandbox App][sandbox-app]{:target="_blank"} to test the payment flow in the Sandbox environment during your development phase.

```kotlin
private lateinit var cashAppPay: CashAppPay

private val cashAppPayListener =
    object : CashAppPayListener {
        override fun cashAppPayStateDidChange(newState: CashAppPayState) {
           // TODO()
        }
    }
    
...    
        
private fun initializeCashAppSDK() {
    cashAppPay = CashAppPayFactory.createSandbox(Afterpay.environment.payKitClientId) // sandbox
      
      or 
      
    cashAppPay = CashAppPayFactory.create(Afterpay.environment.payKitClientId) // production
    cashAppPay.registerForStateUpdates(cashAppPayListener)
}
```

### States

`CashAppPayState` is a sealed class. Some states are for information only, but most will drive the logic of your integration. The most critical states to handle are in the table below:

| State  | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| `ReadyToAuthorize` | You should show the Cash App Pay button in your UI and call `authorizeCustomerRequest()` when it is tapped. |
| `Approved` | Grants are ready for your app to send to Afterpay SDK. |
| `Declined` | Customer has declined the Cash App Pay authorization and must start the flow over or choose a new payment method. |
| `CashAppPayExceptionState` | The general wrapper state for exceptions. These can range from integration errors to network errors. The exception states are emitted only for unrecoverable error states. |

Handling of each of these states is outlined in further detail below.

## Step 3: Begin checkout

Begin checkout process by requesting data from Afterpay. Optionally, supply data on the customer, order total, and items being purchased. Set `configuration` now if you failed to set it previously.

```kotlin
Afterpay.beginCheckoutV3WithCashAppPay(
    consumer = // TODO,
    orderTotal = // TODO,
    items = // TODO,
    configuration = // TODO, optional,
).let { result: Result<CheckoutV3CashAppPay> ->
   // see next step...
}
```

## Step 4: Save result

You will receive a `Result<CheckoutV3CashAppPay>` on success or failure. When successful, save the `result` for later and begin the customer request process.

```kotlin
private var checkoutV3CashAppPay: CheckoutV3CashAppPay? = null

    result.onSuccess {
        checkoutV3CashAppPay = it
        createCashAppPayCustomerRequest(it)
    }

    result.onFailure { error ->
        // TODO handle error
    }

```

## Step 5: Create customer request

Using the `CheckoutV3CashAppPay` from the previous step, create a `OneTimeAction` with Cash App Pay SDK. Also supply the redirect URI which matches the `IntentFilter` defined in your `AndroidManifest.xml` (see above)

```kotlin
fun createCashAppPayCustomerRequest(checkoutV3CashAppPay: CheckoutV3CashAppPay) {
    val redirectUri = "example://example.com/"
    // must convert from dollars to cents
    val cents = (checkoutV3CashAppPay.amount * 100).toInt()
    val action = CashAppPayPaymentAction.OneTimeAction(
        currency = USD,
        amount = cents,
        scopeId = checkoutV3CashAppPay.brandId,
    )

    cashAppPay.createCustomerRequest(
        action,
        redirectUri = redirectUri,
    )
}
```

## Step 6: Respond to ReadyToAuthorize

Inside the `CashAppPayListener` you created earlier, respond to `ReadyToAuthorize` state by enabling your "Pay With Cash App" button:

```kotlin
private val cashAppPayListener =
    object : CashAppPayListener {
        override fun cashAppPayStateDidChange(newState: CashAppPayState) {
            when (newState) {
                is ReadyToAuthorize -> {
                    lifecycleScope.launch { // jump back to UI thread to update UI
                        bindings.cashappPayButton.isEnabled = true
                    }
                }
               ... // other states 
            }
        }
    }

```

## Step 7: Authorize when customer clicks button

When beginning the authorization request, Cash App Pay SDK will redirect the Customer to Cash App, where they can approve or decline the grant request.

```kotlin
bindings.cashappPayButton.apply {
    setOnClickListener { _ ->
        cashAppPay.authorizeCustomerRequest()
    }
}
```

## Step 8: Disable button when authorization is in flight

Avoid duplicate button clicks by disabling once an authorization is detected.

```kotlin
private val cashAppPayListener =
    object : CashAppPayListener {
        override fun cashAppPayStateDidChange(newState: CashAppPayState) {
            when (newState) {
                Authorizing -> {
                    bindings.cashappPayButton.isEnabled = false
                }
               ... // other states 
            }
        }
    }
```

## Step 9: Respond to Approved or Declined

Cash App Pay SDK will redirect back to your app (per the supplied redirect URI). `CashAppPayListener` will receive either a `Approved` or `Declined` response.

```kotlin
private val cashAppPayListener =
    object : CashAppPayListener {
        override fun cashAppPayStateDidChange(newState: CashAppPayState) {
            Log.d(tag, "cashAppPayStateDidChange: ${newState::class.java}")
            when (newState) {
                is Approved -> {
                    newState.responseData.apply {
                        grants?.get(0)?.let { grant: Grant ->
                            confirmCheckoutWithAfterpay(
                                grantId = grant.id,
                                customerId = grant.customerId,
                            )
                        }
                    }
                }

                Declined -> {
                    // TODO 
                }
               ... // other states 
            }
        }
    }
```

# Step 10: Pass grant back to Afterpay

By combining the `CheckoutV3CashAppPay` you stored before, with the newly received `grantId` and `customerId`, you can now confirm checkout with Afterpay

```kotlin
fun confirmCheckoutWithAfterpay(
    grantId: String,
    customerId: String,
) {
    checkoutV3CashAppPay?.let { it ->
        Afterpay.confirmCheckoutV3WithCashAppPay(
            grantId = grantId,
            customerId = customerId,
            token = it.token,
            singleUseCardToken = it.singleUseCardToken,
            jwt = it.jwt,
            configuration = createCheckoutV3Configuration(),
        ).let { result: Result<CheckoutV3Data> ->
            result.onSuccess {
             // TODO next step
            }

            result.onFailure {
             // TODO
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Step 11: Receive one-time use card details and process

The success result will contain card details, tokens, and a valid-until time. Pass these back to your own server and process them through your normal card processing infrastructure, or pass them on to another mobile card processing SDK .

```kotlin
result.onSuccess {
    it.cardDetails
    it.tokens
    it.cardValidUntil
}
```

## Step 12: Unregister

You should also use the **Unregister** function when you're done with the SDK:

``` kotlin
cashAppPay.unregisterFromStateUpdates()
```
