#Afterpay SDK Android Sample App

This sample app contains five `Activities`, each showcasing a specific variant of using the SDK.

Think of the variants as different approaches (with benefits and drawbacks) to handling payment via Afterpay.


| Variant               | Afterpay                 | Afterpay via CashApp    |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| V1 "Standard Checkout" | WIP                      | N/A                     |
| V2 "Express Checkout" | AfterpayV2SampleActivity                      | WIP                     |
| V3                    | AfterpayV3SampleActivity | CashAppV3SampleActivity |

To toggle which variant to display, update the `AndroidManifest.xml` to launch one specific `Activity`.
